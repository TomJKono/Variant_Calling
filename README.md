# Variant_Calling
Variant calling from high throughput sequence data. These scripts are written to
work on the University of Minnesota Supercomputing Institute's compute clusters.
The scripts in this repository will take advantage of list-based processing
tools to handle batches of samples.

Parameters for the stages of variant calling are defined in a central
configuration file.
